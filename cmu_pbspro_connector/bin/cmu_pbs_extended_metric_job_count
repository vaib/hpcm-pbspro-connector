# This wrapper script assumes

# Purpose:
# This script is used to create a job_count file that organizes
# the registered PBS nodes into buckets based on the number of
# jobs on the node. The job_count file will be used
# as input for the ActionAndAlertsFile.txt
# /opt/cmu/bin/cmu_submit_extended_metrics -f/tmp/job_count
