#===========================================================================================
# Description of the alert reactions. Format is:
# Alert_name [Alert_name2...] "Reaction message" ReactOnRaise|ReactAlways command(s)
#
# NOTES
#
#  ReactOnRaise|ReactAlways have the following meanings:
#
#    ReactOnRaise  - Execute 'command(s)' when alert shows as raised provided it was not raised on the last monitoring pass.
#    ReactAlways   - Execute 'command(s)' when alert shows as raised (at the alert's time multiple).
#
# 'command(s)' are any valid Linux commands.  The following keywords are supported in the 'command(s)'
#  string.  A global substitution (throughout the command line) is done for each keyword before 'command(s)' is executed.
#
#    CMU_ALERT_NAME             - The name of the alert
#    CMU_ALERT_LEVEL            - The level of the alert.
#    CMU_REACT_MESSAGE          - The text of the reaction's "Reaction message"
#    CMU_ALERT_NODES            - The list of all nodes that raised the alert during the current monitoring
#                                 pass. The list is condensed in the form provided by cmu_condense_nodes.
#    CMU_ALERT_ NODES_EXPANDED  - The same as CMU_ALERT_NODES only the list is expanded, ordered and separated by commas.
#    CMU_ALERT_VALUES           - The list of alert values.  This list is comma separated and ordered
#                                 like the names of CMU_ALERT_NODES_EXPANDED.
#    CMU_ALERT_TIMES            - The times the alert was triggered on each node.  This list is comma
#                                 separated and ordered like the names of CMU_ALERT_NODES_EXPANDED.
#    CMU_ALERT_SEQUENCE_FILE    - The path of the HPCM "sequence" file containing the alerts and
#                                 alert values from the current monitoring pass.
