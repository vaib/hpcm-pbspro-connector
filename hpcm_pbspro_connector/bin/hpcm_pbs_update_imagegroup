# Script to automatically update PBS Professional with HPCM configured
# groupings: image_groups.
#
# HPCM Image Groups: A image group in HPCM represents a disk
#       image that has been captured (backed up). Based on this definition the
#       image group will be associated to the PBS Professional application
#       operating environment (aoe) native resource.

# TO-DO / Considerations:
# - Consider using some type of caching to avoid pushing unnecessary changes
# - Consider ability to [automatically] remove a group from a node that is no
#   longer being used. At the moment, the script will only 'add' configs.

# Source in the /etc/pbs.conf file
