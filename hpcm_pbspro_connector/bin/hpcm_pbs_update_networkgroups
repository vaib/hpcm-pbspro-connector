# Script to automatically update PBS Professional with HPCM configured
# groupings: network_groups.
#
# HPCM Network Groups: A network group in HPCM corresponds to
#       a single network group that connects to a group of nodes. Based on this
#       definition the network group will be associated to a PBS Professional
#       custom string_array resource called hp_network.
#
# PBS Professional supports the creation of node groupings (aka placement sets).
# These node grouping do NOT need to be tied to network switches, but it is a
# common use case in the field.

# TO-DO / Considerations:
# - Consider using some type of caching to avoid pushing unnecessary changes
# - Consider ability to [automatically] remove a group from a node that is no
#   longer being used. At the moment, the script will only 'add' configs.
