# Assumption:
# This wrapper script assumes
#  1) PBS Server/Scheduler is running on the HPCM Management Node.
#  2) Script is executed on the HPCM Management Node.

# Purpose:
# This wrapper script is used for putting node(s) online or taking node(s)
# offline _and_ setting the flag (external to PBS) that the node was
# taken offline deliberately.
# If node(s) are taken offline, they will be put into a custom group
# called node_offline, which will be seen in HPCM.

# Source in PBS specific environment variables from pbs.conf
