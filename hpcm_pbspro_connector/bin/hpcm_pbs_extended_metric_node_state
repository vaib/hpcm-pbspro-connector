# Assumption:
# This wrapper script assumes
#  1) PBS Server/Scheduler is running on the HPCM Management Node.
#  2) Script is executed on the HPCM Management Node.

# Purpose:
# This script is used to create a node_state file that organizes
# the registered PBS nodes into their respective states (free, busy,
# job-busy, down, offline, etc). The node_state file will be used
# as input for the ActionAndAlertsFile.txt
# /opt/cmu/bin/cmu_submit_extended_metrics -f/tmp/node_state

# Source in PBS specific environment variables from pbs.conf
if [ -f /etc/pbs.conf ]; then
