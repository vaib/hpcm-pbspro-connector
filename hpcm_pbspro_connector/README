Notes
   (Irrespective of flat or hierarchical system, if user wishes, he can have dedicated machine for scheduler.)
   (talk about deployment options here and talk about requirements like ssh (pwdless) to node, users, remote cmd invocation)
   (README file will need to specify the requirement that the PBS client commands are to be installed on the admin node.
   o   qmgr -c "set server managers += <site_user_account>" - - optional instructions)
   (example user admin1 logged into the GUI and he is added to the managers list then he is allowed to make changes to the scheduler)
   mention os provisioning changes. user need to supply kernal, roofs type and node type via environment variable (e.g. PBS_HPCM_KERNAL) in qsub. also pbsnodes will have resources_available.kernal=<list of kernal> fetched by using a command as part of provisioning setup.
   list of nodes: compute, ice-compute, leader list of rootfs type: disk, ramfs
   a hook will run when vnode is restarted to get list of kernals which is set as a list to resources_available.kernal. periodically this list is refreshed. kernal as a custom string-array resources is set up.
   requires pwd-less ssh from server to admin
   Added support for PBS HA.
   - Admin can start/stop services on primary or secondary or both.
   - A configuration file in json format need to be imported to the OS provisioning hook. Update name of admin node in the config file. 

   Install option 1: Using dedicated node
   - PBS Professional Server/Scheduler is installed on the Service Node
   - PBS Professional MOM is installed in HPCM image_groups (os images)
   - PBS Professional Client commands are installed on the Admin Node.

   Install option 2: Using shared node
   - PBS Professional Server/Scheduler is installed on the Admin Node
   - PBS Professional MOM is installed in HPCM image_groups (os images)
   - PBS Professional Client commands are installed on the Admin Node.

Prerequisites
 - PBS Professional Server/Scheduler is installed on the Service Node
 - PBS Professional MOM is installed in HPCM image_groups (os images)
 - PBS Professional Client commands are installed on the Admin Node.

Installation Instructions
On the Admin Node do the following:

1. Copy hpcm_pbspro_connector tarball to /opt/clmgr/contrib

cp hpcm_pbspro_connector*.tar.gz /opt/clmgr/contrib

2. Change directory to /opt/clmgr/contrib

cd /opt/clmgr/contrib

3. Unpackage hpcm_pbspro_connector tarball

tar zxvf hpcm_pbspro_connector*.tar.gz

4. Update /opt/clmgr/etc/ActionAndAlertsFile.txt w/ the PBS_Specific_ActionAndAlerts.txt
   NOTE: File contains PBS Professional specific configurations that need to be incorporated in /opt/clmgr/etc/ActionAndAlertsFile.txt file.

MANUALLY ADDED PBS PROFESSIONAL SPECIFIC CONTENT TO THE DESIGNATED AREAS OF THE FILE.

5. Update /opt/clmgr/etc/cmu_custom_menu w/ the PBS_Specific_hpcm_custom_menu
   NOTE: File contains PBS Professional specific configurations that need to be incorporated in /opt/clmgr/etc/cmu_custom_menu
