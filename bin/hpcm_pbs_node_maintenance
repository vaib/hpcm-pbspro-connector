# Assumption:
# This wrapper script assumes
#  1) PBS Server/Scheduler is running on the HPCM Management Node.
#  2) Script is executed on the HPCM Management Node.

# Purpose:
# This wrapper script is used for putting node(s) into production or
# moving nodes into maintenance _and_ setting the flag (external to PBS)
# that the node was taken offline deliberately.
# Otherwise, the node monitor may assume a node is in need of repair and
# automatically bring it back online.

# Source in PBS specific environment variables from pbs.conf
